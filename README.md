# araclx.ENV() {

**araclx.ENV** stands for modularity, scalability and performance. This stack was designed to archive most performance followed by developer-friendly solutions provided by few programming languages and tools, it's focused to be tool-agnostic which makes it suitable for most companies and developers.

It's more informal version of our technology stack, if you're looking for detailed one [click here](./pages/beta.md)

## 1. Programming Languages

**araclx.ENV** uses mainly few programming languages that provides comfort for developers and good scalability for company products. Behind main languages there are other languages that are used in some components, scripts or other places where it simplifies task.

| Language                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) | Superset of JavaScript that provides a type-safe and scalable development. TypeScript is open-source and maintained by Microsoft. We're using TypeScript literally everywhere because good performance and developer toolkit.                       |
| [**Go**](https://golang.org/)                     | Go is simple language that provides a lot of performance without writting tons of code. Go is open-source and maintained by Google. We're using Go to build cloud-native applications and extend our TypeScript applications.                       |
| [**Rust**]()                                      | Rust isn't that easy as Go or TypeScript but it pops out in performance. Rust is open-source and maintained by Mozilla Foundation. We're using Rust to develop specific High Performance parts of our applications and to build OS-native features. |

In our tech-stack we **don't** use **PHP**, **Python**, **Ruby** or other trash-lang because we have enough technical debt and we don't wanna make it deeper. Just jokeing, we don't have much technical debt, but we was sure about these laguages - programming software in Python in 2020 is just like WTF. Behind our main languages we're commonly using **ReasonML** for functional programing, **C++** where performance is really important element, and **JavaScript** where TypeScript would be useless layer.
