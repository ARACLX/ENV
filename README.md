## Programming Languages

aralcx.ENV is based on few, yet very scalable and modular programming languages which provides great performance and are developer-friendly.

- **TypeScript**
- **Go**
- **Rust**

In some cases we're using a few other languages such as **ReasonML** as a functional language, or **C++** to develop specific parts of software where performance is a crucial element which needs to be covered.
