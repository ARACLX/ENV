### Infrastucture

Our infrastucture is mostly based on **DigitalOcean** and **Google Cloud Platform**, because in our opinion these solutions are actually best IaaSes on the market. Behind IaaS we're using also some PaaS solutions - mainly **Heroku/Flynn** and **Vercel**. In case of both IaaSes that we're using we're implementing **Kubernetes** into automated infrastucture by **Terraform**.

### Business Tools

> Currently we're using **Jira** and **ZenHub** for issue management, but we're found some interesting alternatives - **Zepel** and **Linear**. They both are simple to use, yet powerfull tools but since they don't have integrations yet it's hard to introduce them to our workflow.

Our communication needs are covered by **Slack**, combined with **Twist** and **Tandem** at some cases. Additionally we're using **Carrot** for building cross-platform posts that are important for our teams.
