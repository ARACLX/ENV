## Application and Data

### Programming Languages

| Language       | Description                                                                                                                       | Purpose                                                                                     |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **TypeScript** | Superset of JavaScript that provides a type-safe and scalable development. TypeScript is open-source and maintained by Microsoft. | We're using TypeScript literally everywhere because good performance and developer toolkit. |
| **Go**         | ...                                                                                                                               | ...                                                                                         |
| **Rust**       | Rust is low-end language which offers high-performance.                                                                           | ...                                                                                         |

### API Management

API management software allows users to monitor, control, and monetize their application program interfaces (APIs) in a secure development environment. These tools help administrators monitor connection consistency, traffic, errors, and security for their team’s published APIs.

- Postman

### API Design

API design software allows users to plan, create, and make changes to application programming interfaces (APIs) in a secure development environment. These tools help handle the pre-production management for APIs by enabling developers to ideate, set design guidelines, and ultimately build APIs under one dashboard.

- SwaggerHub
- Postman

### Feature Management

Feature management software facilitates the orchestration of feature rollouts and rollbacks for deployed applications. Developers use this software to manage feature flags, or “toggles," that control whether a given feature is live in an application. Feature management software relieves the logistical complexities of managing feature flags by providing a centralized hub for granular control and monitoring.

### Software Testing

Software testing software gives development teams the methods and tools to determine the quality of their software creation and improvement projects. Development teams use software testing tools to assess whether software is usable, performs properly, meets development team goals, and meets overall requirements.

- UserTesting
- Postman
- Cypress
- SauceLabs

## Infrastructure

### Infrastucture-as-a-Service (IaaS)

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) describes the various ways in which third-party vendors provide cloud-driven, cloud-hosted infrastructure to businesses. This infrastructure comes in a variety of forms, including (but not limited to) public clouds, virtual machines (VMs), bare metal servers, and high-performance computing (HPC). Because of the incredible diversity of IaaS tools, any organization or user within a business could find benefit from the business employing IaaS.

| Service                 | Description |
| :---------------------- | :---------- |
| **DigitalOcean**        | ...         |
| **Vultr**               | ...         |
| **Google Cloud Engine** | ...         |

### Hypercovered Infrastucture (HCI)

Hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) solutions offer businesses the ability to virtualize storage, servers, and their connecting networks. Unlike converged infrastructure, hyperconverged infrastructure leans into software definition as opposed to hardware definition, enabling higher overall flexibility and better expense management over infrastructure use.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Platform as a service, or PaaS, is cloud computing model that provides users with hosted development kits, database tools, and application management capabilities. Third-party vendors provide users with virtual resources to build, deploy, and launch software applications, reducing the need for back-end software development. Businesses utilize PaaS to outsource hosting, database construction, cloud security capabilities, and data storage.

| Service     | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| Heroku      | ...         |
| Flynn       | ...         |
| Platform.sh | ...         |

## DevOps

### Version Control System (VSC)

Version control systems, also known as revision control or source control systems, are used to track changes to software development projects, and allow team members to change and collaborate on the same files. Version control systems allow developers to work simultaneously on code and isolate their own work through branches.

- GitHub

### Containerisation

#### Container Engines

Container engines, often referred to as operating-system-level virtualization, are operating systems in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated instances. Each instance is referred to as a container, virtualization engine, or jail. Developers use these to create secure, virtual hosting environments with isolated resources. Developers can also separate applications, programs, or segments of code for increased security.

- Docker

#### Container Management

Container management platforms facilitate the organization and virtualization of software containers, which may also be referred to as operating-system-level virtualizations. Developers use containers to launch, test, and secure applications in resource-independent environments. Containers house components of applications, libraries, or groups of source code that can be executed on demand. The management platforms help users allocate resources to optimize efficiency and balance system workloads. Containers provide a flexible, portable platform to organize, automate, and distribute applications.

- WeaveWorks

#### Container Orchestration

Container orchestration software allows developers to deploy multiple containers for implementation within applications. These tools help IT administrators automate the process of running instances, provisioning hosts, and linking containers. These tools assist in optimizing orchestration procedures and extending the lifecycle of applications containing multiple containers. They can also facilitate deployment, identify failed container implementations, and manage application configurations.

- Kubernetes
- Nomad
- D2iQ

#### Container Registry

Container registries allow users to manage containers distributed throughout their applications and networks. The registry controls privileges to individual containers and allows users to organize and govern their visibility and accessibility. These registries can come in the form of a hosted service or an on-premise solution using local infrastructure. Companies utilize container registries to manage container configurations, store container images, and access them for deployment.
