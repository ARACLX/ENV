## Infrastructure

### Infrastucture-as-a-Service (IaaS)

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) describes the various ways in which third-party vendors provide cloud-driven, cloud-hosted infrastructure to businesses. This infrastructure comes in a variety of forms, including (but not limited to) public clouds, virtual machines (VMs), bare metal servers, and high-performance computing (HPC). Because of the incredible diversity of IaaS tools, any organization or user within a business could find benefit from the business employing IaaS.

| Service                 | Description |
| :---------------------- | :---------- |
| **DigitalOcean**        | ...         |
| **Vultr**               | ...         |
| **Google Cloud Engine** | ...         |

### Hypercovered Infrastucture (HCI)

Hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) solutions offer businesses the ability to virtualize storage, servers, and their connecting networks. Unlike converged infrastructure, hyperconverged infrastructure leans into software definition as opposed to hardware definition, enabling higher overall flexibility and better expense management over infrastructure use.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Platform as a service, or PaaS, is cloud computing model that provides users with hosted development kits, database tools, and application management capabilities. Third-party vendors provide users with virtual resources to build, deploy, and launch software applications, reducing the need for back-end software development. Businesses utilize PaaS to outsource hosting, database construction, cloud security capabilities, and data storage.

| Service     | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| Heroku      | ...         |
| Flynn       | ...         |
| Platform.sh | ...         |
