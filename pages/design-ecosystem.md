# Araclx DesignOps

We're really crazy at point of great UX, in that point we're using tools of titans when it comes to desing applications. Our [Design Process]() will be available at [Archestyle]() documentation.

Our main design tools are [Sketch]() and [Framer](), where [Sketch]() is used to build design of interfaces and then make prototype on [Framer]()/[Overflow]().

Meanwhile in the process we're using [InVision]() to combine it with **Sketch**, additionally we're controlling version with [Plant]() (in future we're planning migration to [Abstract]()) and sharing design using [Wake](). As our main solution for buildig design systems we're using [Lingo]().

When we're using sketch we're using multiple assistants and plugins mentioned bellow, with some useful software for MacOS:

- ...
- PixelSnap
- CleanShot

We're testing our interfazes using [Maze]() before we'll push them forward to understand our users and make changes that can improve flow in our products.
